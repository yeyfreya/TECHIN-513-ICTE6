    "### Q3.1 What does the max leaf nodes argument describe for a Decision Tree model?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `max_leaf_nodes` argument in a Decision Tree model specifies the maximum number of leaf nodes the tree can have. Limiting the number of leaf nodes helps control the model's complexity, balancing between overfitting and underfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model is too complex, capturing noise in the training data, which leads to poor performance on new data. Underfitting happens when the model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data, resulting in poor performance both on training and new data. Adjusting `max_leaf_nodes` is a way to find a sweet spot where the model is complex enough to capture essential patterns without fitting to the noise."
